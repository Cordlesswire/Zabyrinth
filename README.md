 - This project was a learning experience and therefore the code may not be well commented and much of it could be done better, however, it works.
 - The code is not intended to be compilable(though it could be with a little work). It is intentionally missing some files namely the cocos2dx stuff.
 - I release most of the code for this project to be a source of example code for a complete cocos2dx physics game.
 - points of interest may be the physics handling as well as the random maze generator.
